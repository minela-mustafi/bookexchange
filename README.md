# Book-Exchange

Book Exchange web application is imagined for people who want to borrow, lend, receive
and gift books from and to other people. It allows people to connect and exchange books
with each other.

The purpose of this project is as follows:
1. Eliminating the need to depend on the libraries for borrowing books and
restrictions that come with it
2. Creating a much larger book database and increasing the chances for people to find
books they are looking for (that they cannot find in the libraries)
3. Enabling users to put books that only lay on their shelves to use by lending them to
others, or even gifting the ones that they donâ€™t need anymore
4. Connecting with fellow bookworms
